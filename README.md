# My personal dotfiles
So of course, as everyone else on Github, I finally succumbed to uploading my dotfiles. This is mostly because I have certain (useful) features that I tend to forget to add to dotfiles on different devices. So really this is just to keep my stuff synced up so I don't run into issues such as "why does my vim not search case insensitive anymore???" when in fact it was a different .vimrc anyway.

Currently, "dotfiles" means just my init.vim (neovim's .vimrc). It's really not that interesting.

Planning to bootstrap the process of installing Conqueror of Completion on Neovim, as well as the language servers for Python and C, at some point.

## Important links
Very annoying to lose these. Neovim & CoC tends to sometimes break because of nodejs. So:

- [Nodejs Distribution](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#debinstall)
- [Conqueror of Completion Extension Page](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/Using-coc-extensions)
- [coc-pyright](https://github.com/fannheyward/coc-pyright)
- [coc-clangd](https://github.com/clangd/coc-clangd)
- [coc-sh](https://github.com/josa42/coc-sh)


## Contributing
Uh, sure, you can open issues to tell me how idiotic some stuff I have around here is. It might help me. I mostly don't really care how the configs look though.
